# Documentation

This is the main documentation for the cherrybomb application.

Documentation for C++ and Python components is made using Doxygen.
Documentation for JavaScript and Typescript components is made using TypeDoc.

This documentation folder can be built and hosted as a website for sharing.

## Building the docs

This is yet to be implemented.
